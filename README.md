# signalflow

A TikZ library by Karlheinz Ochs used to draw signal flow diagrams as seen in [Example: Signal flow building blocks](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/signal-flow-building-blocks/)

This repository is an attempt to fix problems with `\matrix` as illustrated
here: [signalflowdiagram does not draw anything with
`\matrix`](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/462786/791).
